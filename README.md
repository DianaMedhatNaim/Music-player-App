## requirements
Select a potential structure and create an app with that structure in Android Studio.
App should have 3 to 6 Activities.
The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app.
Each activity contains a TextView which explains the purpose of the activity.
Each button’s behavior is determined by an OnClickListener in the Java code rather than by the android:onClick attribute in the XML Layout.
Each button properly opens the intended activity using an explicit Intent.
Code is properly-formatted, readable and runs error-free.
